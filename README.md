# DeepL Chrome Extension
The Brave Browser Extension that provides an iFrame of the DeepL Translator. 

This extension may be a reasonable replacement for the Google Translator since the DeepL Translator has a better privacy policy. 
You can easily verify that no one collects the data you enter in the DeepL Chrome Extension, except the DeepL company, of course, because the amount of code is tiny.
